 	 <h2>Principal's Speech</h2>
 	 <p>
 	 	SIBS is all about - educating minds and hearts of all our students 
 	 	at all times during their stay here. Students of classes 11 and 12 are more particularly important to us as 
 	 	this period of their study represents a special turning point in their lives. It poses on them a challenge 
 	 	of not only growing up, but also a challenge of dealing with academic issues that are quite different and 
 	 	humongous; and that this has to be assimilated within a short span of time. Therefore, it is imperative for 
 	 	all our teachers and staff to place optimum importance in the rearing of these students. In view of that end, 
 	 	we would like to be vigilant in all aspects of our students' scholastic as well other human growth concerns.
