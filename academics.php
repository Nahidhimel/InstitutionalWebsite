 	 	<h2>Vision And Goal</h2>
 	 	<p>The words "Advancing in Wisdom and Virtue" in the monogram of the institution best serves the purpose and goals of the institution.
 	 	 The prime goals of the institution are to impart quality education to the students, get them possessed with the best of human qualities,
 	 	 make them aware of their rights and responsibilities, develop their leadership quality, promote their sense of morality, social values, 
 	 	 fellow feeling and brotherhood and thus creating a complete man. SIBS is not only an academic institution, but a place where 
 	 	 creativity is nurtured and nourished, individuality is developed at full pelt and social commitment is embedded. Leaders are not born, 
 	 	 they are created here.
		 </p>

 	 	<h2>Administration</h2>
 	 	<p>We in SBIS think administration as a part of the academic curicullum. We have a school board that governs the school. The chairman of 
 	 	the school is elected by the vote of the board member. Principal is the General Secretary of the board. Some other members of the board
 	 	is elected from the gaurdian and teachers by the vote of all the gaurdians, teachers and school associates.</p>

 	 	<h2>Department</h2>
 	 	<p>When we started our journey, we created department considering subjects that we have to teach in Secondary and Higher Secondary level.
 	 	We now have Bangla, English, Math, Physics, Religion, Chemistry, Social Science, Business Studies department. Every department has a department
 	 	head and senior, associste and assistant teacher.</p>

 	 	<h2>Library</h2>
 	 	<p>A composite of two four-storey buildings with a two-storey building in the annex for teachers and office is located in an elite and 
 	 	posh area of Dhaka City. The institution has a large idyllic campus of about 1.5 acres with playgrounds such as football ground, 
 	 	basketball ground, volleyball ground, table tennis ground, etc. It has a very gigantic open auditorium adjacent to the main buildings 
 	 	accommodating more than 2000 people. The classrooms of the institution are spacious, well-ventilated and well-furnished. The students 
 	 	of classes VI to XII are given individual desks.</p>
